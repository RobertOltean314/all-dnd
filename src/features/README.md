## Features Directory

This directory contains feature-based modules. Each feature should be self-contained and include:

- Components specific to the feature
- Feature-specific hooks
- Feature-specific utils
- Feature-specific types
- Feature-specific state management

Example structure for a feature:
```
feature/
├── components/     # React components
├── hooks/         # Feature-specific hooks
├── utils/         # Feature-specific utilities
├── types/         # TypeScript types/interfaces
└── index.js       # Public API
```
